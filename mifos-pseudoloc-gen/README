This Maven plugin filters the default message bundles, creating resource
bundles for a "pseudolocale" useful for visual inspection of the Web UI
for messages which are/aren't translatable. It's a dev/test tool.

It takes messages like this from a default string bundle:

  key=value

and converts them to, for instance:

  key=@@@value^^^

to make them visually stand out as translatable. A hard-coded string
will lack the prefix/suffix, letting a developer/tester know that code
should be modified. Also, it will be clear which strings are
cobbled-together or "lego" messages (something which impedes or prevents
translation).

The maven-pseudoloc-gen plugin is still used. There are only a few lines
of code that do the actual work, see MifosPseudolocaleMojo.execute() for
more information.

See our 'pseudo' locale test server, listed on
